        <h2>Why be a Mentor?</h2>
        <p>Many successful people credit one or more mentors who made a big difference in helping them achieve early success. Mentoring isn’t just useful for the person you’re assisting. Mentoring provides that wonderful feeling you get when you help someone and make a difference in his or her life. Also, being a mentor can help yourcareer. You’ll be challenged to stay at the top of your game to provide your charge with up-to-date advice. This will make you even better at what you do and a more valuable employee to your boss. What’s more, sharing with a younger colleague what you’ve learned and the mistakes you’ve made enables your organization to progress at a faster pace, with greater productivity. Mentoring will likely also inspire fresh ideas since you’ll be stepping out of your normal circle of friends and associates.</p>
        <p>But mentoring can also be a boon if you’re retired or nearing that stage of your life. Retirees often feel isolated, crave more social interaction and need ways to stay cognitively challenged. They also want to do things that feel meaningful and help them retain a sense of purpose. Mentoring helps you deal with all of those issues. Studies have shown that the more active you are, the healthier you are, so mentoring at this age can be beneficial physically and mentally.</p>

            <h3>What a Mentor can do for you?</h3>
            <p>Mentors are positive people by definition. It takes a positive person to give of himself of herself to help another learn, grow and succeed. The best mentors will help you learn and grow by sharing their knowledge and wisdom with you. In this way, you can benefit from their experience without having to suffer the consequences of gaining that experience firsthand. They can help you to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Achieve personal growth, learn more about themselves.</li>
              <li>Improve their self-esteem and feel they are making a difference.</li>
              <li>Gain a better understanding of other cultures and develop a greater appreciation for diversity.</li>
              <li>Feel more productive and have a better attitude at work.</li>
              <li>Enhance their relationships with their own children.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can enter into a formal mentoring relationship. Or you can just observe people you admire. They can mentor you without even realizing they are doing so. And, it’s never too early to become a mentor yourself. There is always someone who needs your career advice; someone who needs to know what you’ve already learned. Be a positive person. Help others achieve the life and career success they want and deserve.</p>

        <h2>How can you become a Mentor?</h2>
        <p>As you begin your journey toward becoming a mentor, you will need to thoroughly understand the role of mentoring. Look at a role you are already familiar with. Most of us have had a supervisor, a boss or coach who has made a positive difference in our lives. Those people wore many hats. They acted as, delegators, role models, cheerleaders, policy enforcers, advocates, and friends. As a mentor you will wear these same hats.</p>
        <p>Mentors understand the need to assume a number of different roles during the course of a mentoring relationship, but successful mentors also share the same basic qualities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A sincere desire to be involved with a young person.</li>
          <li>Respect for young people.</li>
          <li>Active listener.</li>
          <li>Empathy.</li>
          <li>See solutions and opportunities.</li>
          <li>Be flexible and open.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Good mentors are willing to take time to get to know their mentees, to learn new things that are important to the young person, and even to be changed by their relationship. Accept the challenges and rewards of mentoring a young person and experience the benefits that will last each of you a lifetime.</p>
